# Welcome House Party Protocol

**House Party Protocol (HPP)** is a cost-efficient, scalable, and developer-friendly Layer 2 (L2) network built on the Arbitrum Orbit. Secured by Ethereum and enhanced through data availability with Eigen DA, HPP delivers modular and performant infrastructure for the next generation of decentralized applications.

At its core, HPP is a unified AI-powered blockchain and data infrastructure, co-developed in collaboration with **Aergo, Alpha Quark (AQT), Booost, and VaaSBlock**. Designed to bridge the gap between enterprise-grade systems and decentralized networks, HPP focuses on three critical pillars: trustworthy data, verifiable AI, and real-world scalability.

Through its partnership with [Conduit](https://www.conduit.xyz/) as a Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) provider, HPP enables developers to quickly and easily deploy rollup nodes, accelerating the growth of an open and accessible Web3 ecosystem.

### Why HPP?

The era of hype-driven blockchains is behind us. As the industry matures, attention is shifting toward platforms that solve real problems, support real users, and deliver real value.

**HPP (House Party Protocol)** emerges from this changing landscape as a next-generation platform built on the proven foundation of **Aergo** â€” a hybrid blockchain network trusted by governments, enterprises, and institutions across industries.

Aergo has already powered mission-critical applications in logistics, decentralized voting, official document verification in healthcare, and more. By bridging traditional systems' reliability with public networks' openness, Aergo has helped Web2 organizations transition to Web3.

HPP builds on this legacy, expanding the vision with modern infrastructure designed for AI-native, data-centric, and enterprise-ready use cases.&#x20;

### Interoperability and Modularity at Scale

As part of the Arbitrum Orbit initiative, HPP is building a highly interoperable and modular chain architecture that supports shared liquidity, secure bridging, decentralized governance, and routine upgrades. Leveraging Eigen DA for data availability, HPP enhances scalability while maintaining transparency and resilience at the network level.

### Built for Developers

HPP is fully EVM-compatible, offering seamless integration with widely adopted Ethereum development tools and frameworks. Developers can leverage familiar workflows while benefiting from significantly lower costs and higher performance, enabling the deployment of AI-integrated, data-centric applications at scale.

House Party Protocol is building the future of decentralized infrastructure, where intelligent systems, secure data, and open access converge. By collaborating with key ecosystem partners and empowering developers, HPP brings us one step closer to a world where Web3 becomes as natural and accessible as Web2.
