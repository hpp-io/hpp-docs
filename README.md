# Welcome House Party Protocol

House Party Protocol (HPP) is a cost-efficient, scalable, and developer-friendly Layer 2 (L2) network built on the Arbitrum Orbit. Secured by Ethereum and enhanced through data availability with Celestia, HPP delivers modular and performant infrastructure for the next generation of decentralized applications.

At its core, HPP is a unified AI-powered blockchain and data infrastructure, co-developed in collaboration with Aergo, Alpha Quark (AQT), Booost, and VaaSBlock. Designed to bridge the gap between enterprise-grade systems and decentralized networks, HPP focuses on three critical pillars: trustworthy data, verifiable AI, and real-world scalability.

Through its partnership with Alchemy as a Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) provider, HPP enables developers to quickly and easily deploy rollup nodes, accelerating the growth of an open and accessible Web3 ecosystem.

### Interoperability and Modularity at Scale

As part of the Arbitrum Orbit initiative, HPP is building a highly interoperable and modular chain architecture that supports shared liquidity, secure bridging, decentralized governance, and routine upgrades. Leveraging Celestia’s modular blockchain for data availability, HPP enhances scalability while maintaining transparency and resilience at the network level.

### Built for Developers

HPP is fully EVM-compatible, offering seamless integration with widely adopted Ethereum development tools and frameworks. Developers can leverage familiar workflows while benefiting from significantly lower costs and higher performance—enabling the deployment of AI-integrated, data-centric applications at scale.

House Party Protocol is building the future of decentralized infrastructure—where intelligent systems, secure data, and open access converge. By collaborating with key ecosystem partners and empowering developers, HPP brings us one step closer to a world where Web3 becomes as natural and accessible as Web2.
