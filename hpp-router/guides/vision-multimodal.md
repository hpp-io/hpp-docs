# Vision / Multimodal

Vision-capable models accept images alongside text in the same chat completion request. HPP Router uses the OpenAI `image_url` content-part format. For Anthropic routes, the gateway converts `image_url` parts into native image blocks before calling the provider.

## Request

Use an array of content parts in a message, mixing `text` and `image_url`:

```bash
curl -X POST https://router.hpp.io/llm/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "apikey: $HPPROUTER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
    "messages": [{
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        { "type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?" },
        {
          "type": "image_url",
          "image_url": {
            "url": "data:image/png;base64,BASE64_PNG",
            "detail": "auto"
          }
        }
      ]
    }],
    "max_tokens": 256
  }'
```

## Content parts

| Part type | Fields |
| --- | --- |
| `text` | `text` — the text segment. |
| `image_url` | `image_url.url` (a data URL or HTTP URL) and optional `image_url.detail`. |

You can include multiple `image_url` parts in a single message.

## Using a data URL

When embedding image bytes directly, use a data URL of the form `data:image/png;base64,<BASE64>`. Replace `BASE64_PNG` with the base64-encoded image bytes.

## With smart routing

You can use `hpprouter/auto` with multimodal content. Routing follows the same basket/tier rules, and the token estimate includes the image parts. See [Smart Routing](../smart-routing.md).

## Important distinctions

- **Vision is not image generation.** This endpoint is for *understanding* images in a chat. To *generate* images, use [Image Generation](./image-generation.md) (`gpt-image-1` at `/v1/images/generations`).
- **Use a vision-capable model.** For example `openai/gpt-4o`.

## Provider limits

Provider attachment limits apply (for example, OpenAI ~20 MB per image, Anthropic ~5 MB per image). The gateway does **not** resize attachments — send images within the provider's limits.
