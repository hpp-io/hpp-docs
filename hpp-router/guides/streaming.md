description: Stream chat completions from HPP Router as Server-Sent Events.

# Streaming

Set `stream: true` to receive the completion incrementally as **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** instead of waiting for the full response.

```
POST https://router.hpp.io/llm/v1/chat/completions
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: text/event-stream
```

## REST (curl)

```bash
curl -N -X POST https://router.hpp.io/llm/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "apikey: $HPPROUTER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-5",
    "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Stream a short answer." }],
    "stream": true
  }'
```

The response is a stream of `data:` lines, each carrying a partial chunk, terminated by `data: [DONE]`:

```
data: {"choices":[{"delta":{"content":"He"}}]}

data: {"choices":[{"delta":{"content":"llo"}}]}

data: [DONE]
```

## TypeScript SDK

```ts
import { HppRouter } from '@hpprouter/sdk';

const client = new HppRouter({
  apiKey: process.env.HPPROUTER_API_KEY!,
  baseURL: 'https://router.hpp.io',
});

const { stream, meta } = await client.chat.stream({
  model: 'openai/gpt-5',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Stream a short answer.' }],
});

for await (const event of stream) {
  console.log(event);
}

console.log(meta.resolvedModel);
```

## Streaming and smart routing

Streaming has a special interaction with [`hpprouter/auto`](../smart-routing.md):

> When `stream: true`, basket classification is **skipped** and the request always uses the configured **streaming fallback** model.

This is intentional — it prioritizes the stability of the SSE pipeline over per-request model selection. If you need fine-grained model selection, send a non-streaming request, or specify an explicit `provider/model` instead of `hpprouter/auto`.

## Usage accounting

Token usage is captured from the streamed response and billed the same way as non-streaming requests. Because usage logging is asynchronous, it does not add latency to the stream.

## Tips

- Use the `-N` flag with curl (no buffering) to see chunks as they arrive.
- Pass `stream_options` to forward provider-specific streaming options.
- Very large or long-running streams are best consumed from a backend or the Playground rather than an interactive API explorer.
