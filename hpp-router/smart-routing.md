# Smart Routing (`hpprouter/auto`)

Smart routing answers one question:

> **"Can this request be handled by a cheaper model without sacrificing quality?"**

When you send `model: "hpprouter/auto"`, the gateway classifies the request and routes it to a real `provider/model` defined by rules — in the style of OpenRouter's virtual model IDs. Your client only ever specifies `hpprouter/auto`; the gateway does the rest.

## Using it

```bash
curl -sS -D /tmp/headers.txt -o /tmp/out.json \
  -X POST https://router.hpp.io/llm/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "apikey: $HPPROUTER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "hpprouter/auto",
    "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Summarize this in one sentence." }],
    "max_tokens": 128,
    "stream": false
  }'

grep -i x-hpp-router /tmp/headers.txt
# X-HPP-Router-Resolved-Model: openai/gpt-4o-mini   (example; depends on rules)
```

You do not need to read the resolved model — server-side billing and logging handle it for you. The header is there for observability and optional logging.

## How requests are classified

Routing is **rule-based** (no ML scoring): a fixed set of rules plus configuration stored in the database. A request falls into one of three baskets, evaluated in order:

| Basket | Matches when | Routes to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A — Tool** | the request has a `tools` array or `tool_choice` | the configured tool model |
| **B — Simple** | a known keyword matches, **or** estimated input tokens ≤ a configured threshold | the configured simple-text model |
| **C — Complex** | none of the above | a tier (T1/T2/T3) chosen by token bands |

Token counts are estimated with a tokenizer (not raw character count), plus a configurable margin used for the complex token bands.

### Streaming exception

If `stream: true`, basket classification is **skipped** and the request always uses the configured **streaming fallback** model. This prioritizes the stability of the streaming (SSE) pipeline. See [Streaming](./guides/streaming.md).

## Response metadata

For direct API callers, smart-routing metadata is returned as HTTP response headers:

| Header | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `X-HPP-Router-Resolved-Model` | The actual `provider/model` used for routing and billing. |
| `X-HPP-Router-Basket` | The basket the request was classified into. |
| `X-HPP-Router-Rule-Id` | The rule that matched. |
| `X-HPP-Router-Rules-Version` | The active rules version (for auditing). |
| `X-HPP-Router-Tier` | The tier (when applicable). |

:::tip Reading headers in the browser
To read `X-HPP-Router-*` headers from browser JavaScript, the gateway must expose them via CORS. The browser DevTools Network tab shows the headers regardless of CORS.

## Billing

Billing always uses the **resolved** model's pricing and the upstream `usage` — there is no separate price for `hpprouter/auto`. The resolved model is recorded in your [usage logs](./guides/quota-and-usage.md).

## Notes for client apps

To adopt smart routing, change the request `model` to `hpprouter/auto` — nothing else. Clients that only read `choices`/`usage` need no changes; extra metadata lives in headers and is optional to consume.
