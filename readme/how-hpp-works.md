# How HPP Works

**HPP (House Party Protocol)** is a modular, multi-layered blockchain infrastructure designed to power intelligent, data-driven, and enterprise-grade applications. It combines the credibility of established networks like Aergo with the scalability and flexibility of next-gen Layer 2 architectures.

Here’s how it all comes together:

**1. Dual-Layer Architecture**

* **Aergo Mainnet (Layer 1):**\
  Provides enterprise-grade reliability, decentralized governance, and smart contract support for verifiable logic and identity systems.
* **HPP Layer 2 on Arbitrum Orbit:**\
  Built using the ARB Stack, HPP L2 delivers high throughput, low fees, and full EVM compatibility, making it ideal for real-time AI-native and data-intensive use cases.

#### **2. AI-Native by Design**

HPP is built with AI-first applications in mind, whether it’s decentralized inference, model marketplaces, or autonomous agents. The network will integrate compute oracles and support AI execution layers that bring trust and transparency to intelligent systems.

#### 3. **Data-Centric Infrastructure**

At its core, HPP is designed for secure and verifiable data exchange. It enables decentralized data markets, tokenized datasets, and AI models to interact through smart contracts, all anchored by enterprise-grade infrastructure and cryptographic guarantees.
