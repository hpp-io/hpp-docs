# Deploy a Smart Contract

HPP is compatible with Arbitrum Orbit based EVM, so you can build your Dapp using Solidity language.

Choose your preferred tool and deploy your contract.

### Cookbook.dev

[Cookbook.dev](https://www.cookbook.dev/) is an open-source smart contract registry where developers can find solidity primitives, libraries, and smart contracts for protocols. It provides an easy and fast way to develop smart contracts by integrating with a variety of blockchain-native developer tools.

You can deploy to HPP using Cooking Book's no-code deploy, and you can use with Remix, Hardhat, and Foundry.
