# Development frameworks

> The original version of this document is [Arbitrum Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/reference/development-frameworks).

The following tools will help you develop and test your decentralized apps (dApps):

### Hardhat

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is a comprehensive development environment designed specifically for Ethereum, Arbitrum and, in general, EVM developers. It streamlines the process of creating, compiling, deploying, testing, and debugging smart contracts. By providing a robust and customizable framework, Hardhat makes it easy to manage complex projects and integrate with other tools in the ecosystem. Its features include a built-in console, advanced debugging capabilities, and support for extending functionality through plugins, allowing developers to create efficient and secure decentralized applications.

### Foundry

[Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) is a high-performance, portable, and modular toolkit designed for EVM application development, leveraging the Rust programming language. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools to streamline the process of creating, testing, and deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum, Arbitrum and, in general, any EVM network. Foundry facilitates seamless interaction with EVM smart contracts, transactions, and chain data, while also providing a local node and a user-friendly Solidity REPL environment for efficient development.

### Truffle

[Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) is a comprehensive suite of tools for smart contract development, providing an end-to-end solution for building, testing, debugging, and deploying on Ethereum, Arbitrum and other EVM compatible chains. It features advanced debugging capabilities, fast EVM simulation with Ganache, a user-centered design with a VS Code extension, and robust parent and child chain support. Truffle prioritizes security and partners with ConsenSys Diligence to bring continuous security to projects, providing a seamless and secure developer experience.

### Thirdweb

[Thirdweb SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/sdk) covers all aspects of the Web3 development stack, including connecting to userâ€™s wallets, interacting with the blockchain and smart contracts, decentralized storage, authentication, and more; enabling you to build scalable and performant Web3 applications on any EVM-compatible blockchain. Out of the box, infrastructure is provided for everything required to create decentralized applications, including connection to the blockchain (RPC), decentralized storage (IPFS + pinning services), and tools to create powerful user experiences; such as gasless transactions, wallet connection components, FIAT on-ramps, data APIs, and more.
